# NumPy Learning Series (Phase 1–4)

This repository contains my learning journey of **NumPy for Machine Learning & AI**.  
I have divided the learning process into **4 phases (Day 1–4)**, each with explanations and practice exercises in Jupyter Notebooks.

---

📘 Contents

- **Phase 1 (Basics):**  
  Creating arrays, reshaping, indexing, slicing, and random number generation.

- **Phase 2 (Intermediate):**  
  Aggregations, conditions, dot products, statistics, and axis operations.

- **Phase 3 (Linear Algebra):**  
  Determinants, inverses, eigenvalues, eigenvectors, and matrix operations.

- **Phase 4 (ML Utilities):**  
  Handling missing values, standardization, one-hot encoding, train-test split, and mini-batches.
